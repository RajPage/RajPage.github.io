Hello.

I have a thirst of knowledge. I plan to document my journey on this quest.

I'm going to be learning languages, maths, creative writing and general software development among a myriad of things.

My plan for the year is as follows:

- Sanderson 2023 Reading Challenge,
- Dive into Data Science,
- Spanish till A2,
- Marvel Reading Challenge,
- and much more.

The reader can checkout the entire backlog [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JoQNnL9WppsSXEyyYItskj12twzdzOUHmfD3NZRQd9M/edit?usp=sharing)

Finally, my blog will have random ramblings. I hope the reader feels as if they are listening to a friend.
